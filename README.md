PyNE2 Component Stub/Template
===============================

This template repository is designed to provide a starting environment to develop
a new component of the PyNE2 collection of tools.

The following changes are necessary to specialize it to a new component after
making a new repository based on this template:
1. set the value of the `PYNE2_COMP_NAME` in `CMakeLists.txt` at the top level
2. rename `src/python/pyne2_stub_version.py` to replace the substring `stub` in
   the file name
